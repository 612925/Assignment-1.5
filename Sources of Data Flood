Data is any raw facts and with the current level of computing technology almost everything we do is collected 
as data in one or another way.
Right from facebook photos/videos to online shopping or even an browsing at a online shop generates so much data which is hard to handle 
by a single computer.
Facebook generates about 7 petabytes of data, one of the common example of a source.
Likewise Internet archives, Social media, Government quantitative data, surveys, Scientific experiments, Emails/Conversation all contribute
to data flooding.
